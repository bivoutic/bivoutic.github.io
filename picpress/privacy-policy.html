    <h1>Privacy Policy for PicPress</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date: December 30, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy governs the use of the mobile application <strong>PicPress</strong> (the "Application"), provided by <strong>bivoutic apps</strong> ("we," "us," or "our").</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Privacy Commitment:</strong> Your images never leave your device. All compression and optimization are performed locally. We do not have access to your photos.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Data Processing and Local Storage</h2>

    <h3>A. User Images and Media Files</h3>
    <p>PicPress processes your images <strong>locally on your device</strong>. Images are loaded into memory, compressed according to your settings, and saved to your storage. We do not upload your images to any servers.</p>

    <h3>B. Application Settings</h3>
    <p>We use Android's DataStore to save your preferences (Compression quality, resolution presets, and output folder paths) locally. This data remains on your device and is not shared with us.</p>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>

    <p>To provide certain features and maintain application stability, we use the following third-party services which may collect limited data:</p>

    <h3>A. Advertising (Google AdMob)</h3>
    <p>The free version of PicPress uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect and use data such as your device's advertising ID to show relevant ads. <strong>Note: Users who purchase "Pro Mode" will have all advertising and related tracking disabled.</strong></p>

    <h3>B. Stability and Performance (Firebase Crashlytics)</h3>
    <p>We use Firebase Crashlytics to collect anonymous crash reports. This helps us identify and fix bugs. These reports include technical information like device model, OS version, and the stack trace of the crash, but <strong>no personal information or user images</strong>.</p>

    <h3>C. In-App Purchases (Google Play Billing)</h3>
    <p>If you purchase Pro Mode, the transaction is handled securely by the Google Play Store. We do not collect or store your credit card or payment information.</p>

    <h2>3. Permissions Required</h2>

        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Permission</th>

            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The Application does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. As our processing is local, we do not have a way to identify the age of our users.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy periodically. We will notify you of changes by updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this page.</p>
