<h2>Privacy Policy for Calculator</h2>

<p><strong>Effective Date: December 30, 2025</strong></p>

<p>
This Privacy Policy explains how the <strong>Calculator</strong> mobile application (the "App"), created by <strong>bivoutic apps</strong> (the "Developer" or "We"), handles information collected from users (each, a "User") of the App.

    <h3>Data Safety Declaration</h3>
    <p>
        In accordance with the Google Play Data Safety requirements, we disclose that this App uses third-party SDKs (Google AdMob and Google Play Billing) which collect and share the following data types for advertising, analytics, and fraud prevention:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Location:</strong> Approximate location (IP-based).</li>
        <li><strong>Device or Other IDs:</strong> Advertising ID (AAID).</li>
        <li><strong>Financial Information:</strong> Purchase history related to in-app purchases.</li>
        <li><strong>App Info and Performance:</strong> Crash logs and diagnostics.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All data is encrypted in transit via HTTPS.</p>
</div>

<hr>

<h3>1. Personal Identification Information</h3>

<h4>Data Collected by the Developer</h4>
<p>
The <strong>Calculator</strong> App provides basic mathematical and unit conversion calculations. The Developer does not personally collect, store, or transmit any personal identification data. No registration is required.
</p>

<h4>Data Collected by Third Party Services (AdMob)</h4>
<p>
The App uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display advertisements. AdMob collects certain information to deliver targeted and personalized ads.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Information Collected:</strong> Device Advertising ID (AAID), IP address, device type, and interaction data.</li>
    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Ad personalization, frequency capping, and security.</li>
    <li><strong>Google's Privacy Policy:</strong> 
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank">
            How Google uses information from sites or apps that use their services
        </a>.
    </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>2. In-App Purchases and Billing</h3>

<p>The App offers a "Remove Ads" feature processed via the Google Play Billing Library.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Transaction Processing:</strong> All financial transactions are handled by the Google Play Store. The Developer does not have access to your credit card or banking details.</li>
    <li><strong>Purchase History:</strong> We receive a purchase token and confirmation to verify your ad-free status. This is linked to your Google Account.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>3. Advertising ID and Opt-Out</h3>

<p>
This App accesses the Android Advertising ID to provide a better advertising experience. 
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Opt-Out:</strong> Users can opt-out of interest-based advertising or reset their Advertising ID by visiting their Android Device Settings > Google > Ads.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>4. Data Retention and Deletion</h3>
<p>
Since we do not store personal user data on our own servers, we do not have a specific data deletion mechanism for developer-side data. However, data collected by Google (AdMob/Billing) is managed according to Google’s data retention policies. Users may contact us for any inquiries regarding data usage.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>5. Security</h3>

<p>
We prioritize the security of any data handled by the App. While we use industry-standard practices and SDKs that utilize encryption in transit, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>6. Contact Us</h3>

<p>
If you have questions regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact <strong>bivoutic apps</strong> through bivoutic.apps@gmail.com.
